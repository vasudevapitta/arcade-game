# FRONT END NANODEGREE ARCADE GAME
## Object Oriented Programming

To successfully run the app
Must have the index.html in the root folder and css, js and images folders.
The js folder has the js files.
1. app.js
2. engine.js
3. resources.js

I wrote the game functionality in app.js using ES6 Classes - Superclass, Subclass, extends, super
I coded the classes with default object parameters which allows the developer to instantiate new objects with custom values for the parameters instantly.

I made sure the code is formatted with consistent, logical, and easy-to-read formatting as described in the Udacity JavaScript Style Guide.


Dependencies
None at this time. Coded using Vanilla JS ES6 features.

Students should use this [rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/projects/2696458597/rubric) for self-checking their submission. Make sure the functions you write are **object-oriented** - either class functions (like Player and Enemy) or class prototype functions such as Enemy.prototype.checkCollisions, and that the keyword 'this' is used appropriately within your class and class prototype functions to refer to the object the function is called upon. Also be sure that the **readme.md** file is updated with your instructions on both how to 1. Run and 2. Play your arcade game.
